# Stock Investing Strategy: Buy the Dip

This repository explores a novel stock investing strategy: **buying a stock when it drops 2% in a single day**. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy compared to traditional methods, such as **monthly investing** in the S&P 500.

## Overview

In this project, I tested the "Buy the Dip" strategy by:

1. Tracking individual stocks and buying them whenever they experienced a 2% drop in a single day.
2. Comparing the performance of this strategy against the S&P 500 index with a consistent monthly investment strategy.

## Technical Details

- **Jupyter Notebook**: All analyses and calculations are done in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow and replicate.
- **Pandas**: This is my first interaction with the pandas library, which I used for data manipulation and analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to run the analyses.

## Results
The results of this analysis provide insights into the viability of the "Buy the Dip" strategy compared to a more traditional monthly investment in the S&P 500. It is worse than the montly investment strategy
